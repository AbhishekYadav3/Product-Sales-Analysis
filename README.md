PRODUCT SALES ANALYSIS
"I worked on a sales analysis project where I had access to 12 months of sales data, including
details like product line, unit price, quantity, city, branch, date, member type,
payment type, and customer rating. The aim was to analyze this data to drive
strategic business decisions."

Task: 

"I was tasked with answering several key questions to provide actionable insights for the
business:
Analyzing the performance of sales and revenue at the city and branch levels.
Calculating the average price of items sold at each branch within each city.
Identifying which product line contributed the most to total revenue and determining the
percentage distribution of each product line.
Exploring the correlation between quantity sold and rating.
Analyzing the distribution of ratings given by different customer types.
Identifying the most preferred payment type across different cities."

Action: 

"I employed various analytical techniques and tools to address these questions. I used Excel
and Python for data manipulation and analysis. For each question, I:
Aggregated and summarized sales data to analyze performance by city and branch.
Calculated average item prices and revenue contributions using pivot tables and group-by
functions.
Applied correlation analysis to explore the relationship between quantity sold and customer
ratings.
Analyzed rating distributions by customer type and payment preferences by city using data
visualization tools like Power BI and matplotlib for clear representation of
findings."

Result:

"The analysis provided valuable insights, such as identifying high-performing branches and
cities, understanding pricing trends, and pinpointing the most profitable product
lines. The correlation analysis revealed patterns between quantity sold and ratings,
while the distribution of ratings helped understand customer satisfaction across
different types. Additionally, the analysis of payment preferences informed the
company about popular payment methods in various cities, aiding in strategic
decision-making for marketing and customer service improvements."
